# JHUDataScienceExpDataProj2

This repository stores my implementation of the requirements for Project 2 of the course Exploratory Data Analysis of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Coursera Specilization. 

This repository is a collection of R files which produce exploratory plots showing various characteristics of the fine particulate matter (pm2.5) collected in the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site |https://www.epa.gov/technical-air-pollution-resources]. 

Files are named such that each .R file and .PNG file are numbered according to the research question they address. For example, Plot1.R produces Plot1.png and the plot answers question 1 (below).
